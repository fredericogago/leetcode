## ðŸ§  Key Patterns Practiced

### Sliding Window

- Efficiently scans subarrays or substrings
- Avoids nested loops and reduces time complexity to O(n)

### Hash Map Lookup

- Ideal for tracking complements, frequencies, or mappings
- Common in problems like Two Sum, Majority Element, Isomorphic Strings

---

## ðŸ§¾ Recent Takeaways

- The `:=` (walrus operator) enables cleaner inline assignments
- `defaultdict` from `collections` simplifies frequency maps and counters
- Writing clean, testable functions upfront avoids unnecessary refactoring later
